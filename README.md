# Comp3000FYP
This project is for the comp3000 final year module. 

The aim of this project is to create a 2D platformer based around the mechanic of depth. To accomplish this the idea is to have a main layer on which the player will be able to move and then to have parallaxing background layers that the player will have to travel to in order to complete puzzles/aquire items that will allow them to keep progessing on the main layer.

This project will be creating within Unity version: 2019.2.3f1
