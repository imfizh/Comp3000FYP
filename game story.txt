fyp game story

game starts out above world, you are some random girl, start off at the front door of your home and your mom
tells you to go and delivery something to your gran who lives across the hole, you head off to your grans basic
platformer tutorial to learn inital movement, you meet 2 random guys on the way, the first tells you hes been reading
books hes come accross in the ruins and some tell about how when the above world collapse people moved into underground
cities, second guy tells you he's been hearing wierd noises from the hole recently kinda spooky, as you're walking
over the bridge going over the hole it collapses and you fall into darkness
--cutscene
you see your unconcious body lying in a back alley to a cyberpunk style city, some scientist looking dude walks over
and look at you before nodding and then instructing some robots to grab you as he walks away, screen goes black
screen comes back in and you're on an operating table with scientists around you with sparks flying off, screen turns
black again
light in operating room sparks then the lights comes on, youre still normal but sparks fly off you every now and then,
you walk though the lab and get outside where the robots see you leaving and say get her, you do some platforming things
before reaching a dead end, where the robots catch up to you and say do not resist, during the platforming the sparks
coming off you become more frequent, after robots catch up another cut scene, you transform into a lightning being,
similar to killua from hxh, and are thought about combat, after defeating the robots you are told about being able to 
blink.

rest of the game is you going through the city trying to get out.
